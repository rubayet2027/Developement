This is my very first project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A LeetCode Metric User Interface
where you can easily search a certain person's username of Leetcode
and get necessary information.Now it only gives you a piechart 
of how many problems the user have solved(easy, medium, hard).But for 
your kind information ,i want to add that it can be scaleable a lot
and will be useful to you.

Thank you
